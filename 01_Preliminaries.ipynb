    "## Course Literature – [quantecon.org](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/):\n",
    "The website quantecon.org contains all relevant literature for this course. It contains lectures on quantitative economics in the programming languages Python and Julia. The main topics of the course are similar to the ones covered by Sargent and Stachurski. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer a book can download the [pdf](http://quant-econ.net/_static/pdfs/py-quant-econ.pdf) of Sargent and Stachurskis containing all lecture notes. The lecture notes contain many different topics and complicated topics. Since the authors Sargent and Stachurskis dive into complicated topics fairly quickly, I suggest using them as a reference alongside Google to prepare or review topics covered in class.\n",

    "### Basics of Programming – [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python):\n",
    "If you are new to programming, you may find it helpful to do an online programming course to grasp the underlying logic and write your first small programs. I suggest codecademy, which will allow you to write and run code in your browser giving you short explanations and a small task to all basic concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Models – Online Courses/Videos:\n",
    "For additional inputs on the statistical concepts that will be covered on quantecon.org, YouTube can provide you with explanations. Alternatively, online courses such as the [Udemy Machine Learning](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/)  course have a number short videos to give you an intuitive explanation of each concept. Further videos explain how to implement the model in R and Python. The Udemy online course costs $12. There is a vast number of free or paid online courses on the internet. Google it.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "**Machine Learning** was defined by Tom Mitchell as follows:\n",
    "“A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect to some class of tasks **T** and performance measure **P**, if its performance at tasks in **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with experience **E**.” \n",
    "In simpler terms, a computer can improve at performing a task e.g. recognizing handwritten digits by learning how a handwritten digit looks like i.e. getting to know a dataset. [Mitchell, 1997]\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### While writing code – [Stack Overflow](www.stackoverflow.com):\n",
    "Whenever you encounter a problem writing code, Google or the help function are your best guess. First, try to understand the error message. This takes some practice, but you will get better over time. Your next step should be to either call the help function if for example, you are unsure which inputs a certain function needs. Otherwise, you can google the error message. If you google you might want to add the language you code into your search request. In our case, this is “Python 3” \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "Since Python is an open source programming language there is a large community constantly improving it and writing packages. While we are now working in Python 3.6, Python 2.7 is an earlier version, which solves certain issues differently. Keep this in mind if you research a problem.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you google, you will inevitably end up on stack overflow. The latter is the largest developer community and forum. Almost every problem you encounter someone has encountered before you and asked the question on stack overflow. Whenever you write code you spend a fair amount of time researching your problems i.e. reading through stack overflow.\n",

    "### Datasets - [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com):\n",
    "You might decide to analyze a dataset for your final project. There are many open source datasets on the internet. You will find a number of datasets on Kaggle. The website hosts competitions concerned with the analysis of datasets. You will oftentimes find Kernels, an analysis, and explanation which can serve as help and inspiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**!¡!¡ Sections about datasets needs to be expanded.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working together on projects - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/)\n",
    "Git is a version control system  [VCS], which allows you to store different versions and work together with your team members. By **pulling** a file to your machine you can edit it and once you have made changes **commit** and **push** it to the git.\n",

    "# Setting up your programming environment\n",
    "To follow this course, you will need to install the programming language Python on your computer.\n",
    "In addition to the programming language, you will need an Integrated Developer Environment [IDE] i.e. an editor. The editor we will use is Jupyter Notebook. It has the advantage that you can write code and execute it as well as write normal text i.e.  markdown, on the same page. Jupyter Notebook is a browser-based editor. Although Jupyter Notebook will open in your browser the notebook you write in will be saved locally on your computer. If you have never used Jupyter before you might want to watch a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk) video on how to use it.\n",

    "To set up your computer programming ecosystem it is easiest to install a distributor that includes the core programming language Python 3.6 and the editor.\n",
    "The distributor of choice for this course is [**Anaconda**](https://anaconda.org/). Besides the editors, Jupyter Notebook and Spyder, Conda, a packaging tool and installer, will allow you to manage the packages you need to run your code.\n",

    "# How to tackle a programming course and why\n",
    "Programming is not a skill that you acquire once and know it thereafter. Learning how to program is a continuous process, the more time you spend doing it the better you become. Therefore, do not be discouraged if nothing works in the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective should not be to learn all the detailed functions and the syntax of python. Your Focus should lie on the main concepts. If you have learned the main concepts of one language you will be able to apply the latter to different languages. This is an important skill, as different companies use different programming languages and it is likely that you will have to learn a new language at some point in your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of learning how to program in a business school is twofold. One the one hand it is a highly useful skill to be able to solve problems by writing a program. Furthermore, The growing field of data analytics requires a good understanding of programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL. On the other hand, as a manager, it is essential to be able to communicate with a developer and data scientist. Therefore programming is a valuable skill and will help you understand a computer scientists way of solving problems.\n",

    "**!¡!¡ This section needs to be re-designed. Is it adding valuable information.**"

Its markdown integration lets us create fancy \"text-book\"-like documents and neatly comment-out our code for generations to come. It is a relatively new tool and besides having the look of a simple \"notebook\", it offers many functions, for example debugging (for more info on debugging, check out Matthias' notes from session 2).\n",

    "- *Pycharm*: It has a very nice debugger and plays nicely with git (version control system, check out Julian's notes from Session 1). In addition to Python, PyCharm provides support for JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Angular JS, Node.js, and so on, what makes it a good option for web development.\n",

Besides IDEs there are other text editors like \"Atom\" or \"Notepad C++\". But these normally don't come fully equipped like IDEs and often need to be expanded by using so-called \"plug-ins\".
