    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming, or OOP, is one of the most dominant programming paradigms in modern programming. Its popularity has been steadily increasing, from initial attempts at implementation back in the 1960s to being in some of the most prevalent languages today. As a set of programming concepts and design methodologies, it essentially offers a way of thinking about program structure and organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section, we will first look at a comparison of object-oriented programming and two other programming paradigms, namely imperative and functional programming. We will then introduce object-oriented programming in detail, elaborating on the definition and practical implementation of classes, objects and methods in Python. The last section focuses on the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, with examples clarifying each principle."

    "## Comparison of Programming Paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages are often classified by the programming paradigm they mainly support. The features of each programming language often encourage, or even mandate, structuring the various parts of a program in a specific way. While Python is often referred to as an object-oriented language, it is probably best described as a multi-paradigm programming language as its features also support many other programming paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the various paradigms is the way they handle the state of the program, i.e. the values of its variables. Controlling how and where state is transformed in a program has practical implications for how reliable and manageable the code becomes. Each programming pradigm offers a different way of managing state, in the hope that the program does not quickly fall into the trap of \"spaghetti code\", where the code is so badly structured that it becomes too complex to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, three programming paradigms are: \n",
    "1. [Imperative](#imperative_comparison)\n",
    "2. [Functional](#functional_comparison)\n",
    "3. [Object-Oriented](#oop_comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following subsections will illustrate the differences between these three programming paradigms by producing the same output using code organised in these three different ways."

    "### Imperative\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the analogy of programming as a problem-solving methodology, imperative programming defines a program as a series of steps, sequentially running each line of code one by one until a solution is found. While this is often the simplest and most intuitive way to structure small programs (like the one in the example below), larger imperative programs have a tendency to become unreliable and unmanageable. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, why do large imperative programs end up this way? This mainly has to do with how, in imperative programs, all variables are global variables. Assigning a value to a variable, like so:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "changes the value of the variable \"x\" globally, i.e. it changes the \"global state\". In small programs with few variables, this is not a major issue, but in large programs with millions of lines and thousands of variables, it is easy to see how a programmer working on one part of the code may accidentally reuse and reassign a variable that another programmer had already used in a different part of the code. The vulnerability of code to changes in the global state means that imperative programming is prone to what is called \"side effects\" (unexpected output occuring due to unexpected input); this therefore makes imperative programming unsuitable for the creation of large programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following imperative program, we simulate the processes that turn food into solid waste in a human being. "

By limiting direct access to this state and only allowing the object's own public setter methods to modify state in the class, this prevents the unintentional spread of changes made in one part of a program to other parts of the program. Encapsulation is especially important in large and complex projects worked on by teams of programmers, where communication between different parts of the program must be carefully managed."

How exactly does this reduce complexity?   Consider a TV remote. Do we know exactly how each of the buttons on our remote function in everyday usage? Should we be reminded at every press of a button on our remote, that we are making the underlying chip's sensor turn on, producing an electrical signal which is amplified with a transistor, then sent through a LED which finally prompts an infrared light to communicate with our TV?  \n",

In other words, the child class can inherit attributes from the parent class. By simply inheriting from the parent class, we have inherited all its functionality. Python will travel up the inheritance chain (e.g. Gorilla to Monkey) until it finds the called method (init) to be executed. Now, let's customize our subclass a little bit. Adding methods for the child class is no different than adding methods for the parent class. It is not possible to remove inherited attributes, variables and methods from the subclass, as they do not exist in the subclass. However, it is possible to overwrite them, as shown in the example below."

    "Object-oriented programming as a paradigm proves to be an efficient way of organising code. It enables programmers to conceptualise their coding experience differently. They may now think consider all the different parts of their program as objects interacting amongst one other. The four pillars of OOP capture the very essence of why this may be useful. **Encapsulation** isolates changes made the code, facilitating maintenance. **Abstraction** facilitates and simplifies the complexity of the code. **Inheritance** allows sub-classes to inherit aspects from their parent-class. **Polymorphism** allows sub-classes to interact differently with their parent-classes through a common interface. Both polymorphism and Inheritance go hand in hand, while one allows attributes to be the same as the parent class, the other allows them to differ. All in all, OOP provides the user with empowering and enabling tools which serve to improve the organisation and conceptualization experience of everyday programming. "
