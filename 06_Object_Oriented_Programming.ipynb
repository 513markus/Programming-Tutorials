    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is often referred to as a new programming paradigm. Its popularity has been growing for several decades now, starting from the initial attempts back in the 60s to some of the most important languages used nowadays. Being a set of programming concepts and design methodologies, it essentially offers a way of thinking. \n",

It allows us to define our own complex functions, suited to our endeavours, instead of limiting us to the functions integrated in the programming language. The following shows an example in Python of a function of two inputs x and y, defined to multiply the first input x by y. "

    "This is one of the first significant advantages of OOP, it permits us to track modifications of the variables and complex functions our program may have. This is particularly useful as errors arise in the process of overwriting and modifying variables gradually, and becomes particularly troublesome the larger our code is. This is known as an unintentional side effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is also a solution to this issue, however it **isolates these state-changes.** OOP however allows us to **selectively designate which states should be affected** by the functions of our program. \n",

    "To recap: \n",

    "#### 2.2 So what is Object-Oriented programming?    \n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is based on the idea that we are no longer primarily focused on the logic or actions of our program but rather the __data__ itself, in particular the objects of our program. While OOP serves a similar purpose as functional programming - eliminating the global state, it goes further by allowing us to store variables in objects rather than functions. Our programming is therefore centered around the __objects__ themselves. \n",

    "**Encapsulation** refers to the principle of keeping the state of each object private, inside a class. By limiting direct access to this state and only allowing the object's methods to modify state in the class, this prevents the unintentional spread of changes made in one part of a program to other parts of the program. Encapsulation is especially important in large and complex projects worked on by teams of programmers, where communication between different parts of the program must be carefully managed."

    "### 3.2 Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction refers to the principle of displaying essential information by hiding unnecessary information. This is done by creating sub-classes for this unnecessary information. This isolation of the information is similar to encapsulation in the aspect of how it is achieved (creating specific sub-classes), but it has its own purpose: simplicity.  \n",
    "This principle may not seem advantageous at first glance, why would we want to hide information about how the tasks of our program are achieved? How exactly does this reduce complexity?   Let's consider a TV remote, do we know exactly how each of the buttons on our remote functions in everyday usage? Should we be reminded at every press of a button on our remote, that we are making the underlying chip's sensor go off, producing a morse-line code which is amplified with a transistor, then sent through a LED which finally prompts an infrared light to communicate with our TV?  \n",
    "What matters to us is that the power button correctly prompts the power, that the volume button changes the volume, and that the channel changes when we use the button to change channels. The inner-workings of these buttons do not need to be apparent in the common usage of our remote. This is the exact point of abstraction, reducing complexity. Through abstraction we are also able to isolate parts of our code, making its maintenance more efficient by ensuring changes are to be made locally. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance** refers to how an Object-oriented programming language allows the creation of child subclass using the characteristics of an existing parent or super class. In other words, the child class can inherit attributes from the parent class. By simply inheriting from the parent class, we have inherited all its functionality. Python will travel up the inheritance chain (Human to Gorilla) until it finds the called method (init) to be executed. Let's now customize our sub class a little bit. Adding methods for the child class is no different than adding methods for the parent class. It is not possible to remove inherited attributes, variables and methods from the sub class, as they do not exist in the sub class. But you can overwrite them:\n",

    "We have defined two different classes, Dolphin() and Gorilla(), each with their own sing() method. We then defined a generic interface singing(), for the input of any object. Then, passing our two objects, dolphin1 and gorilla1 through this interface, we get differing output, depending on the class of our input. In the case of the Gorilla, it is able to sing. Because gorillas can sing. Duh. Well only Despacito. In the case of our Dolphin, it is sadly unable to sing.  \n",
    "The generic interface serves a similar purpose as a switchboard. We are now able to enter the sing() function of both Gorillas and Dolphins into this interface, which then directs our program to the correct class, allowing it to differentiate the singing() function for our data type, depending on whether it is a Gorilla and Dolphin. Differentiation of our objects is the main strength of Polymorphism. \n",
