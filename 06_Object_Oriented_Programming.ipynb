    "Object-oriented programming, or OOP, is one of the most dominant programming paradigms in modern programming. Its popularity has been steadily increasing, from initial attempts at implementation back in the 60s to being in some of the most prevalent languages today. As a set of programming concepts and design methodologies, it essentially offers a way of thinking about program structure and organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section, we will first look at a comparison of object-oriented programming and two other programming paradigms. We will then introduce object-oriented programming in detail, elaborating on the definition and practical implementation of classes, objects and methods in Python. The last section focuses on the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, with examples clarifying each principle."

    "## 2. Comparison of Programming Paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages are often classified by the programming paradigm they mainly support. The features of each programming language often encourage, or even mandate, structuring the various parts of a program in a specific way. While Python is often referred to as an object-oriented language, it is probably best described as a multi-paradigm programming language as its features also support many other programming paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the various paradigms is the way they handle the state of the program, i.e. the values of its variables. Controlling how and where state is transformed in a program has practical consequences for how reliable and manageable the code becomes. Each programming pradigm offers a different way of managing state, in the hope that the program does not quickly fall into the trap of \"spaghetti code\", where the code is so badly structured that it becomes too complex to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, three programming paradigms are: \n",
    "1. [Imperative](#imperative_comparison)\n",
    "2. [Functional](#functional_comparison)\n",
    "3. [Object-Oriented](#oop_comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following subsections will illustrate the differences between these three programming paradigms by producing the same output using code organised in these three different ways."

    "### 2.1 Imperative\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the analogy of programming as a problem-solving methodology, imperative programming defines a program as a series of steps, sequentially running each line of code, one by one until a solution is found. While this is often the simplest and most intuitive way to structure small programs like the one below, large imperative programs have a tendency to turn into unmanageable \"spaghetti code\". \n",
    "\n",
    "So, why do imperative programs end up in \"spaghetti code\"? This mainly has to do with how, in imperative programs, all variables are global variables. Assigning a value to a variable, like so:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "changes the variable \"x\" globally. In small programs with few variables, this is not a major issue, but in large programs with millions of lines and thousands of variables, it is easy to see how a programmer working on one part of the code may accidentally reuse and reassign a variable that another programmer had already used in a different part of the code. Imperative programming is, therefore, unsuitable for creating large programs.\n",

    "In the following imperative program, we simulate the processes that turn food into solid waste in a human being. "

    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is based on the idea that we are no longer primarily focused on the logic or actions of our program but rather on the data itself, in particular the objects of our program. While object-oriented programming serves a similar purpose as functional programming - eliminating the global state, it does this differently, by allowing us to store variables in objects rather than functions. Our programming is therefore centered around the objects themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what is an object? \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, everything in Python is an object in disguise. Python transforms anything we create into object automatically. More specifically, objects are instances of classes, and these objects have a certain type. For example, 'Hello world' is an object, which is instance of a string. 123456789 an instance of an integer and \\[a, b, c] of a string. \n",

    "\\end{gather*}\n",

    "To illustrate this process more specifically and represent what an object may be, imagine a troop of gorillas. The gorilla as an animalistic species has certain characteristics- a name, height, 2 arms and 2 legs. However exploring every individual gorilla, we find that some of those characteristics vary- for example one animal will be called George and weigh 150 kg, whereas another may be called Harry and weigh 190 kg. The species is the general case of our beast, the class. The individual beast is an instance of our class. This generalization as a class of objects is similar to Plato's concept of the ideal chair that stands for all chairs, or in our case the \"ideal\" gorilla. "

    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation** refers to the principle of keeping the state of each object private, inside a class. By limiting direct access to this state and only allowing the object's methods to modify state in the class, this prevents the unintentional spread of changes made in one part of a program to other parts of the program. Encapsulation is especially important in large and complex projects worked on by teams of programmers, where communication between different parts of the program must be carefully managed."

    "### 4.2 Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction refers to the principle of displaying essential information by hiding unnecessary information. This is done by creating sub-classes for this unnecessary information. This isolation of the information is similar to inheritance in the aspect of how it is achieved (creating specific sub-classes), but it has its own purpose: simplicity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This principle may not seem advantageous at first glance. After all, why would we want to hide information about how the tasks of our program are achieved? How exactly does this reduce complexity?   Consider a TV remote. Do we know exactly how each of the buttons on our remote function in everyday usage? Should we be reminded at every press of a button on our remote, that we are making the underlying chip's sensor go off, producing an electrical signal which is amplified with a transistor, then sent through a LED which finally prompts an infrared light to communicate with our TV?  \n",
    "\n",
    "What matters to us is that the power button correctly prompts the television to turn on, that the volume button changes the volume, and that the channel changes when we use the button to change channels. The inner-workings of these buttons do not need to be apparent in the daily usage of our remote. This is the exact point of abstraction, reducing complexity. Through abstraction we are also able to isolate parts of our code, making its maintenance more efficient by ensuring changes are to be made locally."

    "**Inheritance** refers to how an Object-oriented programming language allows the creation of (child) subclasses using the characteristics of an existing parent or super class. In other words, the child class can inherit attributes from the parent class. By simply inheriting from the parent class, we have inherited all its functionality. Python will travel up the inheritance chain (Human to Gorilla) until it finds the called method (init) to be executed. Let's now customize our subclass a little bit. Adding methods for the child class is no different than adding methods for the parent class. It is not possible to remove inherited attributes, variables and methods from the sub class, as they do not exist in the sub class. But you can overwrite them:\n",
