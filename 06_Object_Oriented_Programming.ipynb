    "\n",
    "1.1 What is a programming paradigm? \n",
    "    \n",
    "A programming paradigm is a way of classifying a programming language based on its features, particularly the way in which its code is organised. \n",
    "        \n",
    "A few of the major existing programming paradigms are: \n",
    "1. [Imperative](#imperative)\n",
    "3. [Functional](#functional)\n",
    "4. [Object-Oriented](#oop)\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"imperative\"></a>\n",
    "**Imperative programming** is a programming paradigm which consists of the provision of commands in a sequential order for a computer to execute. In other words, it is a series of instructions. The following is an illustration of imperative code in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 2\n",
    "y = 3 \n",
    "z = x * y\n",
    "   \n",
    "```\n",
    "<a id=\"functional\"></a>\n",
    "**Functional programming** is a paradigm which treats computation as the [evaluation of mathematical functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) (a series of transformations) instead of progressively changing and mutating data. It allows us to define our own complex functions, suited to our endeavours, instead of limiting us to the functions integrated in the programming language. The following shows an example in Python of a function of two inputs x and y, defined to multiply the first input x by y. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def multiply(x,y):\n",
    "    z = x * y\n",
    "    return z\n",
    "multiply(3,6)\n",
    "```\n",
    "<a id=\"oop\"></a>\n",
    "# **Object-Oriented programming**\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Why do we need Object-Oriented programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the various paradigms is the way they handle the state (the values) of the variables. In procedural languages, all variables are global variables. For example, the following line of code attributes a value to the variable x, one of the particularities is that this assignment affects the global state of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to modify the value of x as such in a later stage of the program, as follows, then the global state of the program is modified. In other words, x is 3 and always has been 3 **(from this stage on?)**, the memory that x had ever been 12 is deleted. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is one of the first significant advantages of OOP, it permits us to track modifications of the variables and complex functions our program may have. This is particularly useful as errors arise in the process of overwriting and modifying variables gradually, and becomes particularly troublesome the larger our code is. This is known as an unintentional side effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is also a solution to this issue, however it **isolates these state-changes.** OOP however allows us to **selectively designate which states should be affected** by the functions of our program. \n",
    "\n",
    "To recap: \n",
    "* Imperative programming transform state progressively\n",
    "* Functional programming strictly isolates state from function\n",
    "* OOP couples state with functions, designating which states are to be modified by these functions\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 So what is Object-Oriented programming?    \n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is based on the idea that we are no longer primarily focused on the logic or actions of our program but rather the data itself, in particular the objects of our program. While OOP serves a similar purpose as functional programming - eliminating the global state, it goes further by allowing us to store variables in objects rather than functions. Our programming is therefore centered around the objects themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate what an object may be, imagine a troop of gorillas. The gorilla as an animalistic species has certain characteristics- a name, height, 2 arms and 2 legs. However exploring every individual gorilla, we find that some of those characteristics vary- for example one animal will be called George and weigh 150 kg, whereas another may be called Harry and weigh 190 kg. The specie is the general case of our beast, the class. The individual beast is an instance of our class. This generalization as a class of objects is similar to Plato's concept of the ideal chair that stands for all chairs, or in our case the \"ideal\" gorilla. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"class\"></a>\n",
    "## Class\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for our generalized object. In our case the gorilla as a species is the class. Let's define our class of the gorilla. Classes are mere descriptions of how our to-be objects should look. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Gorilla: \n",
    "    #class attribute \n",
    "    species = \"Gorilla\"\n",
    "    #instance attribute\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age, weight, height):\n",
    "        self.name = name \n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "        self.weight = weight \n",
    "        self.height = height \n",
    "        \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to higlight that we have defined both class-wide attributes (the species) and instance-specific attributes such as the name and age. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are specific-instances of classes. To instantiate our class, we use Gorilla(name,age): \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "kingkong = Gorilla(\"King Kong\", 15, 170, 1.4)\n",
    "donkeykong = Gorilla(\"Donkey Kong\", 11, 210, 1.6)\n",
    "\n",
    "#class attributes\n",
    "print(\"King Kong is a {}.\".format(kingkong.__class__.species))\n",
    "print(\"Donkey Kong is a {}.\".format(donkeykong.__class__.species))\n",
    "#instance attributes\n",
    "print(\"{} is {} years old, weighs {} kg, and is {} meters tall.\". format(kingkong.name, kingkong.age, kingkong.weight, kingkong.height))\n",
    "print(\"{} is {} years old, weighs {} kg, and is {} meters tall.\". format(donkeykong.name, donkeykong.age, donkeykong.weight, donkeykong.height))\n",
    "```\n",
    "This returns: \n",
    "\n",
    "King Kong is a Gorilla.  \n",
    "Donkey Kong is a Gorilla.  \n",
    "King Kong is 15 years old, weighs 170 kg, and is 1.4 meters tall.  \n",
    "Donkey Kong is 11 years old, weighs 210 kg, and is 1.6 meters tall.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have thus defined an object kingkong, which is a gorilla of name \"King Kong\", and 15 years of age, 170 kilograms and 1.4 meters tall. \n",
    "We have also defined donkeykong, a gorilla of name \"Donkey Kong\", 11 years of age, 210 kilograms and 1.6 meters tall. \n",
    "\n",
    "While their class attributes are the same meaning that both objects are of the species Gorilla, it is important to highlight that their instance attributes differ, their specificities. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are functions used inside classes that form the interface and behaviour of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Gorilla: \n",
    "    #class attribute \n",
    "    species = \"Gorilla\"\n",
    "    #instance attribute\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age, weight, height):\n",
    "        self.name = name \n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "        self.weight = weight \n",
    "        self.height = height \n",
    "    #class method\n",
    "    def eat(self):\n",
    "        return '{} is eating a banana.'.format(self.name)\n",
    "    \n",
    "#class method\n",
    "print(kingkong.eat())\n",
    "print(donkeykong.eat())\n",
    "      \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "King Kong is eating a banana.  \n",
    "Donkey Kong is eating a banana.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the only argument is 'self' here. The \"self\" argument refers to the object or the bound variable itself. The output is the same for King Kong and Donkey Kong. To get instance-specific output we can use their attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Gorilla: \n",
    "        #class attribute \n",
    "    species = \"Gorilla\"\n",

    "    def bananacount(self):\n",
    "        if self.weight > 200:\n",
    "            banana = 400\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            banana = 250\n",
    "        return '{} eats {} bananas'.format(self.name, banana)\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "King Kong eats 250 bananas  \n",
    "Donkey Kong eats 400 bananas\n",

    "## Four Fundamental Principles of Object-oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation** refers to the principle of keeping the state of each object private, inside a class. By limiting direct access to this state and only allowing the object's methods to modify state in the class, this prevents the unintentional spread of changes made in one part of a program to other parts of the program. Encapsulation is especially important in large and complex projects worked on by teams of programmers, where communication between different parts of the program must be carefully managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Gorilla:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, awakeness, colour):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.awakeness = awakeness\n",
    "        self.__colour = colour # Note the double underscore denoting a private attribute\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def currentstate(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} is currently {self.awakeness}.\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def currentcolour(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} is {self.__colour} in colour.\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def spraypaint(self, paint): # Public method that changes the private attribute \"self.__colour\"\n",
    "        self.paint = paint\n",
    "        self.__colour = paint\n",
    "        \n",
    "kingkong = Gorilla(\"King Kong\", \"asleep\", \"black\")\n",
    "\n",
    "kingkong.currentstate()\n",
    "kingkong.awakeness = \"awake\" # Usually, attributes in a class can be directly modified outside the class\n",
    "kingkong.currentstate()\n",
    "print(\"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "kingkong.currentcolour()\n",
    "kingkong.__colour = \"brown\" # However, private attributes cannot be modified outside the class\n",
    "kingkong.currentcolour()\n",
    "print(\"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "kingkong.currentcolour()\n",
    "kingkong.spraypaint(\"red\") # Private attributes can only be modified by public setter methods of the class\n",
    "kingkong.currentcolour()\n",
    "print(\"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** refers to the principle of only putting specifically relevant information in a class. Other information that is only partly relevant should be placed in a subclass (see **Inheritance**). This also benefits the maintanence of large codebases, as changes can be contained within each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance** refers to how an Object-oriented programming language allows the creation of new (child) subclasses using the details of an existing (parent) class. Inheritance is closely associated with the concept of **Abstraction** as it allows programmers to reuse the attributes and methods of the parent class while adding only what is necessary and relevant for each child class.\n",
