    "Human beings take lots of decisions. While you are driving, you can find yourself in front of a traffic light. You take logical decisions depending on the traffic light color. The same occurs with a programming language like Python. Decisions are made when a program has more than one choice of actions depending on the value a variable takes. In the traffic light case, the variable would be the *light color* and the decisions would be *go, stop* or either *prepare to stop* or *to go*. In this lecture, we will go through the Pythons' decision making processes. In the following section we will explain the basic features of **conditionals**, show the different comparison/logical operators supported by Python and explain the concept of chained conditionals.<br>\n",
    "The last section focuses on **Iteration**, where we will explain four different statements: the for, while, break and the continue statements.\n",

    "# Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A conditional is basically a feature of a programming language, which performs different computations of actions depending on whether a boolean condition is evaluated as True or False (remind that boolean data types have two values, usually denoted True and False). It is sometimes usually referred to as an \"if-check\". Think about the following pseudocode, which describes the traffic light problem:\n",
    "<pre><code><div style=\"background-color:rgb(217, 237, 247)\">1: If (traffic light is green - boolean condition) then  \n",
    "2:   (go - consequent)   \n",
    "3: else\n",
    "4:   (either stop or prepare to stop/go - alternative)\n",
    "5: end if\n",
    "</div></code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see above, conditionals basically work according to an **if–then** construct, which is common across many programming languages. Below we will explain its basic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## If-statement\n",
    "When the program finds an **if**, it expects a boolean condition and evaluates that condition. If the condition is True, the statement following the *then* is executed. Otherwise, if the condition is not True, the execution continues in the following branch, that is, the **else** block. What does this actually mean? With the else statement we basically say Python that there is an alternative if the condition is False, in that case we expect Python to execute a different code. The else block is optional, since we may want Python to execute a code just if a certain condition is True. If there is no else branch then the program automatically stops checking conditions. \n",

    "## Chained conditionals\n",
    "Recall the absoute value example in section 1.1. Since we were not interested in the case n = 0, we just had two possibilities: n was either positive or negative. Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches. One way to analyze such a case is through chained conditionals. Here is a basic pseudocode describing how chained conditionals work:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code><div style=\"background-color:rgb(217, 237, 247)\">1: If condition a then  \n",
    "2:   run statement A\n",
    "3: else if condition b then\n",

    "8: else \n",
    "9:   run statement Z\n",
    "10: end if \n",
    "</div></code></pre>\n",
    "How do we interpret this? You may have noticed a new statement: the **else if** statement, or **elif** statement in Python syntax. Python starts checking the first condition (a) and evaluates it. If condition a is True, then it runs the corresponding statement (A). If condition a is actually True, Python stops checking other conditions. If, instead, condition a is False, Python faces the **elif** statement, which does two things: first, it says that there is an alternative (else part). Second it says that there is not just one alternative (if part). That is, the **elif** statements makes Python aware, that what comes after is just one of the alternatives. If condition b is True, then it runs statement B. In this case, Python does not check any condition that comes after condition b. If condition b is False, Python continues checking according to the elif principle. If, say, all conditions from a to y are False, then the only condition left is condition z. Since this is the last condition we want Python to check, we don't use the elif statement anymore. If we do, we imply that there is at least one condition more to be checket. So, when there is just one more condition we want Python to check, we use the usual **else** statement (which is, as already said, optional). We can express the traffic light example as a chained conditional. Have a look at the following pseudocode.\n",
