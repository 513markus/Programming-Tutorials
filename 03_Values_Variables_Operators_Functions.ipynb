    "# Introduction to the topic <a name = \"Introduction to the topic\"> </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, the topics **variables**, **values**, **operators**, **functions** and **encryption and decryption** will be treated. Mainly, the basics of each topic will be introduced eventhough there would be a lot more to learn in each topic. However, if you are new to coding in Python, this tutorial is suited for you as it should help you understand the basics, which is key, before going into more advanced coding. Bear in mind, that one could go into more detail for these topics: If you are interested in learning more to a topic either refer to our links which lead you to external, more in-depth sources or use Google as you can find mostly anything related to Python online. However, before you do this: Make sure you understand the basics presented in this tutorial and that you can apply them. \n",
    "\n",
    "To the content of this tutorial: First, **variables** are looked at. Variables are key in any programming language and often serve as placeholders so that algorithms or functions can be coded and later on used for different values. \n",
    "An algorithm is a step-by-step approach on how to solve a problem. A function relates input to output. Without variables, the code would need to be rewritten for any new value which is rather cumbersome. You can assign different values to a variable as for example a number or a string which is a list of numbers and characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, **values** are introduced. Values are whatever is assigned to a variable. There are several types of variables, such as: strings, numbers or booleans. A boolean is the result of a logical statement, hence a boolean either takes the value *true* or *false*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, **operators** are treated. Operators are used to perform mathematical operations on one or more variables or values. They are nothing else than functions which are already built in in Python. Like values, operators are classified into different types: For example, arithmetic operators such as **+** and **-**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, **functions** are introduced. Functions generally make coding more efficient, as they can be used for solving similar problems for different inputs. There exist different kinds of functions which can be used in Python: Either those which you code and later on call (=use) yourself or the ones that are already built-in in Python: as for example the function print(), which returns whatever is written in parantheses. Additionally, there also exist functions within socalled libraries or packages which first need to be imported into Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fifth, **encryption and decryption** are treated. Encryption and decryption are cryptographic algorithms which can be used for sending secret messages which can only be read by the recipient provided he or she is knowledgeable about the applied algorithm. Encryption is the algorithm which transforms a plain, legible text into an encrypted, unintelligible text. The algorithm which makes encrypted text again intelligible is referred to as decryption. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, a conclusion is provided which sums up the key takeaways of this tutorial such that you can check whether you understood the tutorial's content or whether you have to go over certain parts again."

In order that you can apply the theory and examples of this tutorial to solve new problems.\n",
