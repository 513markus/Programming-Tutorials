# Programming for Quantitative Analysis Notes

## About this Notes

1. [Preliminaries](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/drarnau/Programming-for-Quantitative-Analysis/blob/master/01_Preliminaries.ipynb)

## Style guide
- Each Tutorial should contain a table of contents at the beginning.
- Markdown language offers a neat way to write pseudo-code. [See this question at StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34903115/is-it-possible-to-create-a-code-block-of-pseudocode-in-r-markdown-knitr).
- Whenever writing text in a Jupyter Notebook, use only Markdown and Latex equations. Avoid (as much as possible) the use of HTML.
- Do **not** organize references as you would in a Latex document, use hyper-links and information in brackets.
- Avoid linking other resources of the course like slides or example code provided in StudyNet.
